# Hanabi
I doubt anyone will ever read this but here but basically I am trying to see if I can use machine learning to teach a computer to play [Hanabi](https://www.spillehulen.dk/media/102616/hanabi-card-game-rules.pdf).
I am trying to keep things reasonably maintainable, but some stuff is probably kind of getting hardcoded that shouldn't be and some of 
the architecture and organization isn't extremely well-thought-out. The plan is to create a simulation of a four-person Hanabi game 
wherein each move from the moves possible in a game state is chosen randomly. There are 28(?) possible moves in a four-player game and 
19 (?)
